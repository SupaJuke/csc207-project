#Introduction

In phase1 there is a conference where attendees to said conference can log in, sign up, join events and interact with
other attendees via messages. There are event organizers who can also create events and rooms for events. Organizers
can also message all attendees to an event. There are also speakers that speak at events. Events have a specific
timeslot and room(s). All attendees have a username and password they use to log into the system in order to message or
sign up for events.
