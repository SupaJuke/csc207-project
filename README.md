# csc207-project
This is a project made as a part of the course CSC207 (Fall 2020)

It is a conference management application that has a minimal UI designed for simplicity. It is coded in Java (and JavaFX for the UI).

The project strictly follows the SOLID design principle and Clean Architecture, which allows for a collaboration that does not depend on other colloaborators' choice of coding.
